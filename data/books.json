Tradition                      wrestles with new urban influences as Africans try to sort out their identity in a changing culture. True to the tradition of                       African storytelling, the characters come to life through their distinct voices and speech. If there is no sweetness, there is                     the salt essential to life, even if it comes from tears, and the strength that comes from a history of endurance. ",
